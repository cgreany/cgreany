<h4>Facts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In terms of Bluehost vs HostGator, they’re pretty similar when
    it comes to CPU resources, unmetered bandwidth, disk space, MySQL
    databases, pricing, and more. We find Bluehost user experience to
    be slightly better as they’ve invested heavily in their WordPress
    platform. Bluehost has advantage in overall performance, SSD storage,
    security, and value for money. HostGator tries to beat that with slightly
    cheaper hosting plans, 45-day moneyback guarantee, and faster support.</li>
  <li>GoDaddy is one of the largest domain name registrars and reputable
    hosts. Their performance is good and offers tons of web storage.
    However, it lacks some features like backups, SSL certificates and
    staging areas. It's interface is easy to use and great for beginners.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Top Host: Bluehost</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Bluehost is for those seeking an all-in-one hosting solution in which
    protection and reliability are provided with free SSL, malware detection
    and 24/7 expert support. It is extremely intuitive to set up and

    blogger sites.  </li>
